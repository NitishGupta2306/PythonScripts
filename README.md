# Python Scripts:

CodeBase created : April 5th 2024 by Nitish Gupta

Goal:
This python project is created to write one new python script per day. No reusing scripts made previously. The goal is to create python scripts that can be used in my future code bases.


### Current Scripts:
1. GetTableData: Gets table data from websites or PDF files.
2. PackageInstallation: Package installation for these scripts.
3. SendEmail: Sends email using a passkey and body. You can send multiple emails by setting it in a for loop to run through a list of email recipients.
